In this post, I'll share my workflow for creating LOD chains that maintain visual fidelity while optimizing for real-time rendering.

## Why LODs Matter

When rendering a scene with hundreds of props, each polygon counts. LODs allow the engine to swap high-detail models for simpler versions as objects move further from the camera.

## My LOD Workflow

1. Start with the highest detail - Create your hero model with all the details you need for close-up shots.
2. Use decimation wisely - Tools like Blender's Decimate modifier can help, but manual retopology often yields better results.
3. Preserve silhouettes - The outline of your object is what the eye notices first at distance.
4. Bake details to textures - Normal maps can maintain the illusion of detail on lower poly models.

## Results

Following this workflow, I've been able to reduce poly counts by 80% on LOD2 while maintaining 90% of the visual quality at typical viewing distances.`,coverImage:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558618666-fcd25c85cd64?w=800&h=400&fit=crop",category:"Tutorial",tags:["optimization","LOD","game-art"],publishedAt:"2024-03-15"},{id:"2",title:"My Substance Painter Smart Material Library",excerpt:"Building a reusable material library has transformed my texturing workflow. Here is how I organize mine.",content:`After years of texturing props, I have built up a library of smart materials that I reuse across projects. Let me share how I organize and create these materials.

## The Power of Smart Materials

Smart materials react to mesh data like curvature, ambient occlusion, and world space position. This means they adapt automatically to new meshes.

## Categories I Use

- Metals - Steel, iron, copper, gold variations
- Woods - Aged, painted, varnished, weathered
- Fabrics - Leather, cloth, canvas
- Wear & Damage - Edge wear, scratches, dirt

## Tips for Creating Reusable Materials

1. Use anchor points for flexibility
2. Expose key parameters for easy customization
3. Name layers clearly for future reference
4. Test on multiple meshes before finalizing`,coverImage:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1635070041078-e363dbe005cb?w=800&h=400&fit=crop",category:"Workflow",tags:["substance-painter","texturing","materials"],publishedAt:"2024-02-28"},{id:"3",title:"Breaking Down AAA Game Props",excerpt:"What makes AAA game props stand out? I analyzed props from recent releases to find common patterns.",content:`I spent a week analyzing props from recent AAA releases to understand what makes them work. Here are my findings.

## Common Patterns

### Material Complexity
Most hero props use 2-4 material slots with carefully planned texture atlases.

### Detail Distribution
High-frequency details are concentrated in areas players interact with or look at closely.

### Color Theory
Successful props use limited color palettes with strategic accent colors.

## What I Learned

The best props tell micro-stories through wear patterns and design choices. A weapon isn't just a weapon - it's a history of battles.`,coverImage:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526374965328-7f61d4dc18c5?w=800&h=400&fit=crop",category:"Analysis",tags:["AAA","game-art","study"],publishedAt:"2024-01-20"}],R=[{id:"sr1",videoUrl:"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/utibe-ebong-3d-artist_unrealengine5-3danimation-realtimerendering-activity-7354080763300012034-Wu8a?utm_medium=ios_app&rcm=ACoAADgdYpkBrZNxj-SlzU5pT1Xm4h_YpROB1ok&utm_source=social_share_send&utm_campaign=copy_link",title:"Showreel 2025",description:"A short compilation of selected works showcasing modeling, texturing, and lighting.",poster:"showreel-poster.jpg"},{id:"sr2",videoUrl:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",title:"Showreel — Breakdown",description:"Secondary showreel with process breakdowns and behind-the-scenes shots.",poster:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1542751371-adc38448a05e?w=1200&auto=format&fit=crop&q=60"}],r={about:A,resume:C,contact:B,projects:L,archvizProjects:N,productvizProjects:T,plugins:I,posts:q,showreel:R},U=r.projects||[],H=r.about,E=r.resume,_=r.contact,G=r.plugins||[],V=r.posts||[],O=r.showreel||[],W=r.archvizProjects||[],J=r.productvizProjects||[],F=U,X=H,ee=E,te=_,ae=G,K=V,se=O,m=W,g=J;function ie(){function a(t){return m.find(o=>o.id===t)}return{archvizProjects:m,getProject:a}}function re(){function a(t){return g.find(o=>o.id===t)}return{projects:g,getProject:a}}function oe(a){return F.find(t=>t.id===a)}function ne(a){return K.find(t=>t.id===a)}export{f as B,b as E,w as I,Y as L,j as M,F as a,K as b,m as c,g as d,X as e,re as f,oe as g,te as h,k as i,ne as j,ae as p,ee as r,se as s,ie as u};
